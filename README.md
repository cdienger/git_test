This project is a test repo for new employees of Nagios Enterprises.

It should not be used to do anything important, nor should it be used to store any code that you wish to remain private.

It is the sole responsibility of the Nagios Employee to delete this repository on completion of the companion KB document.

I hope you learn something.

Cheers,
Andy Brist (creator of the Git KB)
